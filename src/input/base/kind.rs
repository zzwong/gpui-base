//! Compile-time input modes.
//!
//! The three input states are one engine seen through a mode marker, one per
//! state:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pub type InputState    = InputBaseState<InputMode>;
//! pub type TextareaState = InputBaseState<TextareaMode>;
//! pub type EditorState   = InputBaseState<EditorMode>;
//! ```
//!
//! A method that only makes sense for one mode lives in that mode's `impl`
//! block, so it does not exist on the others: `InputState` has no `auto_grow`
//! or `soft_wrap`, `TextareaState` has no `masked` or `line_number`, and only
//! `EditorState` performs code actions. Methods shared by the two multi-line
//! modes go on [`MultiLineMode`]. Reaching for the wrong one is a compile
//! error rather than a debug assertion.
//!
//! [`super::LayoutMode`] carries the same distinction at runtime, since the
//! engine branches on it while editing. The marker only decides which API is
//! reachable.
